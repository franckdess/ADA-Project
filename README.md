# Diving deep into the Panama Papers

# Abstract
The Panama Papers are leaked documents that detail the internal operations of one of the world's biggest firms in incorporation of offshore entities, Mossack Fonseca. This Panamanian law firm and corporate service provider had financial and attorney-client information for more than 210 000 offshore entities revealed to the public. While offshore business entities are legal, reporters found that some of the Mossack Fonseca shell corporations were used for illegal purposes, namely fraud, tax evasion, and evading international sanctions.
Therefore one may argue that it is of public and state interest to explore the Panama Papers in order to extract insights about the Key Players involved. To do so we will resort to the ICIJ Offshore Leaks Database.  
We intend to present key figures about the evolution of Mossack Fonseca's clients at different scales over the span of 40 years. Moreover we will link our findings to the economy, laws and policies ecountered by the Key Actors. Finally we will conduct a network analysis of the Panama Papers database to better understand its structure.

# Research questions
- What are the key figures about the evolution of Mossack Fonseca's clients at different scales over the span of 40 years ? How can we put these figures into historical (economy, laws, policies...) context ?
- Is there a link between economic and financial indicators and the involvement of a country ? That is what are the main correlates of evasion ?
- What are the additional insights we may extract from a network analysis of the Panama Papers ? That is network nodes and edges statistics, centrality measures, risky nodes, top communities, pattern recognitions with ML, specific country analysis and so on...
  
# Dataset
We will use the ICIJ Offshore Leaks Panama Papers Dataset found at: https://www.occrp.org/en/panamapapers/database  
The dataset has been made available as CSV files.  
We will also resort to additional data sources about countries economy, laws and policies for the last 50 years.
