# Panama Papers Key Players

# Abstract
The Panama Papers are leaked documents that detail the internal operations of one of the world's biggest firms in incorporation of offshore entities, Mossack Fonseca. This Panamanian law firm and corporate service provider had financial and attorney-client information for more than 210 000 offshore entities revealed to the public. While offshore business entities are legal, reporters found that some of the Mossack Fonseca shell corporations were used for illegal purposes, namely fraud, tax evasion, and evading international sanctions.
Therefore one may argue that it is of public and state interest to explore the Panama Papers in order to extract insights about the Key Players involved. To do so we will resort to the ICIJ Offshore Leaks Database. We intend to present key figures about the evolution of Mossack Fonseca's clients at different scales over the span of 40 years.

# Research questions
A list of research questions you would like to address during the project. 

- What is the number of offshore companies incorporated over the years by Mossack Fonseca ?
- What were the tax heavens used by Mossack Fonseca ? Which were the most popular ?
- What were the countries with the strongest ties to Mossack Fonseca ?
- What were the entities with the strongest ties to Mossack Fonseca ?
- How can we put the evolution of these metrics into historical context ?

# Dataset

We would like to use the ICIJ Offshore Leaks Panama Papers Dataset found at: https://www.occrp.org/en/panamapapers/database  
The database is powered by Neo4j, a graph database. Moreover the dataset has also been made available as CSV files.

# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2
Note that the list is pretty "high level" abstraction at the moment and more implementations details will come.

- Choose a way to manipulate the data
- Access and transform the data for better manipulation
- Define how to tie a country to the Panama Papers
- Define how to tie an entity to the Panama Papers
- Define how to tie a tax heaven to the Panama Papers
- Compute metrics associated to these definitions
- Answer research questions based on these metrics
- Put answers into historical context
- Visualize answers to research questions

# Questions for TAa
It looks like that most of our work will be data acquisitition, transformation, exploratory analysis and visualization. Is it fine or do you expect some other kind of analysis to be performed ?
