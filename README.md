# Panama Papers Key Actors

# Abstract
The Panama Papers are leaked documents that detail the internal operations of one of the world's biggest firms in incorporation of offshore entities, Mossack Fonseca. This Panamanian law firm and corporate service provider had financial and attorney-client information for more than 210 000 offshore entities revealed to the public. While offshore business entities are legal, reporters found that some of the Mossack Fonseca shell corporations were used for illegal purposes, namely fraud, tax evasion, and evading international sanctions.
Therefore one may argue that it is of public and state interest to explore the Panama Papers in order to extract insights about the Key Players involved. To do so we will resort to the ICIJ Offshore Leaks Database.  
First, we intend to present key figures about the evolution of Mossack Fonseca's clients at different scales over the span of 40 years. Secondly, we will try to link our findings to the economy, laws and policies ecountered by the Key Actors over time.

# Research questions
- Can we put the evolution of Mossack Fonseca's clients into historical context ? For instance number of offshore entities vs economic crisis or new tax regulations.    
- Is there a link between the economy, laws and policies of a country and its involvement in the papers ? For instance GDP vs number of offshore entities per country.
  
# Dataset
We will use the ICIJ Offshore Leaks Panama Papers Dataset found at: https://www.occrp.org/en/panamapapers/database  
The database is powered by Neo4j, a graph database. Moreover the dataset has also been made available as CSV files.  
We will also resort to additional data sources about countries economy, laws and policies for the last 40 years.

# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2
Note that the list is pretty "high level" abstraction at the moment and more implementations details will come.

- Choose a way to manipulate the data
- Access and transform the data for better manipulation
- Tie countries to the Panama Papers
- Tie entities to the Panama Papers
- Tie tax heavens to the Panama Papers
- Compute metrics associated to these tasks
- Collect information about countries economy, laws and policies for the last 40 years
- Answer research questions based on metrics queried and information collected
- Visualize answers to research questions

# Questions for TAa
It looks like that most of our work will be data acquisitition, transformation, exploratory analysis and visualization. Is it fine or do you expect some other kind of analysis to be performed ?
